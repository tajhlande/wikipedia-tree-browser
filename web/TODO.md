# TODO tasks for the web application

## Bugs

* Parent button is placing departed nodes too close to their parent (maybe not a bug anymore)

## Usability improvements

* Add descriptive text to main page
* Reorganize node info boxes
* Mobile layout fixes (controls and info boxes)
* Tune the LOD for billboards
* Search across all nodes to cross-navigate tree

## Technical improvements

* Migrate to real db backend

## Aesthetic improvements

* See if replacing leaf with link looks better
* Animate graph transitions (add/remove nodes)
* Consider color and material changes - example: layer on monthly readership or number of edits
* Match node info hover box border color with node color
* Put border on current node box and match with node color
